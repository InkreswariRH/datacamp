# Let's practice writing logical statements and displaying the output.

# Recall that we use the following operators:

# == tests that two values are equal.
# != tests that two values are not equal.
# > and < test that greater than or less than, respectively.
# >= and <= test greater than or equal to or less than or equal to, respectively.


# Instruction 1/3
# The variable height_inches represents the height of a suspect.
# Is height_inches greater than 70 inches?

# Is height_inches greater than 70 inches?
print(height_inches > 70)


# Instruction 2/3
# The variable plate1 represents a license plate number of a suspect.
# Is it equal to FRQ123?

# Is plate1 equal to "FRQ123"?
print(plate1 == "FRQ123")


# Instruction 3/3
# The variable fur_color represents the color of Bayes' fur.
# Check that fur_color is not equal to "brown".

# Is fur_color not equal to "brown"?
print(fur_color != "brown")
